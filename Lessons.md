astro is like jsx without the annoying parts
- front matter is turned into only html
- <script> ships to client
- front-matter executes only on build
client:load (loads js)
cluient:visible (untill on screen)

- /public/ is base level from the server

- YOU CAN NEST LAYOUTS
- you need to slugify (run through slugify function you find online) links generated from frontmatter
