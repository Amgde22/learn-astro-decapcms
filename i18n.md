# how to add language suppoer to this project

## 1. context / doccumentation
- this project uses astrolicious/i18n to add language support
- website text is stored inside /src/locales/[lang]/common.json
- routing is handled automatically , pages are inside /src/routes/[pagename].astro
- to retrieve text you use the following code
```astro
---
// import t() function in the fronmatter of the astro file
import { getLocalePath, t } from "i18n:astro";
const hero = t("hero", { returnObjects: true }); // get the hero object inside common.json
// (this was retrieved from /src/locales/[lang]/common.json and will automatically return the text based on the language )

const title = hero.title // extract the actual website title text
---
<h1>
{title}
</h1>
```
## goal
add ar  and fr languages to this project

## how to add i18n support
1. go through each file inside /src/routes/[route].astro (they are all hardcoded to be french ) for each file :
    1. extract the text inside /src/locales/fr/common.json (prop name = role of text in the website . example : correct = "hero.heading" , wrong = hero.welcomeToOurSite)
    2. translate all the text from the file into /src/locales/ar/common.json
    3. now that we have the text extracted and translated , go back to the route you got the text from . use t() to get the text . use it in the website

## gotchas :
-  astrolicious doesn't support vue js , so don't modify any vue js component , keep it as is without translation
